Calculation Engine

Usage:
    calc <engine_name> <file_list>
    calc <engine_name> <list of integers>

Files will contain one more more lines of integers. 
All files must be placed in the current working directory.

Engine types:
    multi - multiplies all integers together, only works with file list as
         input data

    div - divides all the integers, one after another. Works with both file 
        list inputs and integer list inputs as input data

All engine output goes to stdout.
